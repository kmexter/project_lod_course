In here are the files needed to turn the EMO BON logsheets into tutle. 

Provided by Katrina
  * The logsheets, gotten from the EMO BON google account (later: get them from EMO BON github), are supplimented with a metadata CSV which explains the logsheet columns. The soil and water samples both are included in here
  * A manual working out of what the triple should look like can be found in a TriplesExplanation document. We experimented with 3 versions of triples, so each TripledExplanation is versioned as well. This is a word document so the comments can be seen also
